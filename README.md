Plant Identification Proposal
--------------------

### Objective 

I enjoy walks around my neighborhood and love the different plants, flowers, shrubbery, and trees the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Occasionally on these walks, I find a depressed palm tree or agave immediately wonder: How did this plant get here? How does it get through waterlogged soils during the wet seasons? While the agaves fare better than most palm trees it's easy to identify what doesn't belong in the evergreen city than the native species. I would like to learn a little more about the native species of my community and help others do the same.

### Plan

Through the use of an API, this site should help users learn more about the local plant life that surrounds their vicinity. In addition to identification, users will be provided with other snippets of information such as images, plant habitat distribution, status (endangered or invasive), edibility, related species, maintenance tips, blooming and fruiting seasons. Users will also be able to search other locations outside of their location and learn about other habitats and it's plant diversity.

### The pages and the features that I imagine the project will need:

* Home Page

  * Search Bar

  * Links to other pages

  * Featured plant of the day

* Search Results page

  * Plants that could be found in user submitted location 

* Plant specific detail page 

   * Contain information specified in the Plan section

  * Ability to bookmark and save? 

* User Plant Collections Page 

* Gallery of user selected plants

* Featured Plant of the Day 

* Facts about the randomly selected plant of the day

### Additional Thoughts

Pollinators are another important part of the plant biodiversity and could be additional information that could be included with the different plant profiles that come up. Pollinator insects are vulnerable to the use of pesticides so it could be helpful to give users ideas to help these critters.
